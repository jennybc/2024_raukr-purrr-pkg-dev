More places to learn about purrr and iteration:

    somewhat dated, but there is still valuable content here*
  * [Row-oriented workflows in R with the tidyverse](https://github.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows#readme)  *caveat:
    this is somewhat dated, but there is still valuable content here*
  * tidyr's [Rectangling vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rectangle.html)
  * dplyr's [Row-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rowwise.html)
  * dplyr's [Column-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html)
